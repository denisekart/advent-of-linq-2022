# ⭐️ Advent of ~~Code~~ LINQ 2022 ⭐️

The [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for year 2022.

Let's do this in [LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/).

> I know, I know - not everything can be solved by LINQ and not every solution is optimal when using LINQ. That being said, LINQ is fun (I promise)!

**Notice*:*

All code written for this years' Advent of Code was synthesized by an organic intelligence (classification pending 😆) called MyBrain™. I do not use intelligent coding assistants or tools to come up with these solutions.

## 🎄🎄 Requirements

* `net7.0` is expected. Download the SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).
* that's it - you didn't expect `node` right?

## 🎄🎄 Outline

Problems added as unit test classes in the project `.\src\AdventOfCode22Tests\AdventOfCode22Tests.csproj` (or you can open the `AdventOfLinq.sln` solution file to find the tests).

Problems will be identified by test classes corresponding on the days of the challenge (e.g. `Day1.cs` will represent the 1st of December challenge).

To run the tests, run the `dotnet test` command in the root of the repository.

To run a specific subset of tests, run the following filtered command:

```pwsh
dotnet test --filter SystemCheck
# or
dotnet test --filter Day0
# or combine them
dotnet test --filter "Day0&SystemCheck"
```

... or do your [worst](https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/main/docs/filter.md).

## 🎄🎄 Other remarks

~~I'll try to commit the results of a particular challenge no less than 24 hours after the next challenge is revealed.~~
I'll commit sooner, everyone is doing it anyway.

For more, follow me ...uhm... here, I guess.

## 🎄🎄 Fun side project

You can also have fun with the tool that lives in this repository called `aoc`. The tool source code is located in the `tools` folder and is installed in this repository as a dotnet tool.

To use the tool, run the `dotnet tool restore` command once. After that, feel free to invoke the tool using the `dotnet aoc` command.

You can of course start from scratch and install the tool where ever you want, just type in the following:

```pwsh
dotnet pack
dotnet tool install --add-source .\tools\nupkg AocTool
```

(but, there's really no need)

See the next sections on what this tool can do.

> Note: If you do not wish to install the tool, commands `dotnet aoc` and `dotnet run --project .\tools --` are completely interchangeable so you can utilize the tool even when it's not installed - it's just a console application (`dotnet run --project .\tools -- --help` === `dotnet aoc --help`).

## 🎄🎄 Lazy?

Yes! Head over to `tool/AocTool.csproj` (or install it using the hints from previous section) to do the following awesome tasks:

* Download your personalized puzzle inputs automatically
* Create pre-populated test classes for the current day
* Log in to https://adventofcode.com/ ...sort of
* Be lazy

Ok, here's how it works...

> Make sure you have a CLI open and are located in this repository root folder (the one that has .git folder in it)

1. Make sure you're logged in to https://adventofcode.com
2. Grab the session token (F12-developer tools -> application -> cookies -> https://adventofcode.com -> session -> [copy the value])
3. Run `dotnet aoc session --set <token from step 2>` which will cache the token locally. Yay! You hacked the AOC (run). You only need to do this once per....idk...didn't bother to check.
4. Run `dotnet aoc load` to download the puzzle data for the current day (or use the `--day` flag - if you're late or something). Check out the new `data` directory being created in the root of the repo.
5. Run `dotnet aoc generate` to generate a test class for the current day(or use the `--day` ....yada yada...you know). Check out a brand new test class in your tests project.
6. That's the easy part... solve the puzzle!

> Btw, if you're stuck with the tool, just run `dotnet aoc --help` - I commented the sh...snow out of it ;)

## 🎄🎄 Lazy² ? - `dotnet aoc makemyday` !

Assuming you are already logged in using the `dotnet aoc session --set <token>`, just type `dotnet aoc makemyday` and enjoy the tool automatically 

* creating a new test class for the current day, 
* downloading your personal data set required for the current days' challenge,
* linking your test data to the newly created test,
* ~~and bringing you a cup of freshly brewed coffee.~~ (still in alpha stage - do not use, may spill some on the keyboard)
